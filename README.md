        <h2>News Inc üìú</h2>
        <h3>You can see it live <span><a href="https://news-inc.web.app/" target="_blank">here</a></span></h3>
        <p>My recent project that I have worked with other talentful programmers is News Inc.</p>
        <p>I was the Data Miner of the News Inc project, in this project, the articles were extracted from 6 newspapers that allow web scraping, these newspapers are from di erent countries. Once the information is extracted it is stored in a non-relational database in Mongo DB.</p>
        <h3>Technologies used in the project: üêç</h3>
        <p>The technologies used for the Data Extraction in this project are Python, Pandas, Requests, XPath, MongoDB, PyYaml, lxml, os library, and Subprocess library.</p>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Team-C5-News-Inc" target="_blank">Here is the repo for the entire project!</a></h4>

        <h2>Handwritten Recognition ü§ñ</h2>
        <p>Handwritten Recognition is a collaboration at Platzi Master, it was made by a powerful team of talentful programmers.</p>
        <p>There were two DS at this project <a href="https://github.com/juanpanu" target="_blank">Juan</a> and me. We were in charge to build the Convolutional Neural Network to analyze two signatures, one stored in a database online, and the other provided by the user, if these two signatures were alike at least 90%, you would get a confirmation that, that is your signature, if not, you would get a message telling you that the signatures were not alike.</p>
        <h3>Technologies used in the project: üêç</h3>
        <p>The technologies used for the development of the Siamese Convolutional Neural Network are Python and Keras.</p>
        <h4>Unfortunately there is no live demo online, but <a href="https://github.com/SWAT-Handwritten-Recognition/" target="_blank">here you can see the repo for the project!</a></h4>

        <h2>Titanic ‚õ¥</h2>
        <p>This project was about calculating the possible ammount of dead people if USS Carpathia and no other ships would have arrived to the place where the Titaninc sunk.</p>
        <h3>Technologies used in the project: üêç</h3>
        <p>The thechnologies used for the development if this project are Python, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.</p>

        <h2>Titanic - Transforming a Data Set with Pandas</h2>
        <p>This was a challenge from Platzi Master, it was fun using Pandas library and the functions to collect the data and get results. In the begining of the colab notebook are the questions to solve with Pandas.</p>
